Sanke Game 

I have created a Snake Game using HTML, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. 
Snake can move in any direction, but when the snake is moving in upward direction it cannot come in downward direction simultaneously. it has to take right or left then 
downward direction, this is how even the actual snake also moves. Same with right and left direction also.

The snake will be able to eat the provided fruit and the tail of the snake increases by 1 block (the shape of the tail is round). after consuming the provided fruit, a new
random position will be given to the fruit (such that snake can eat) and again the snake should consume fruit and it's tail will be increased by 1 block. This process goes on...

the speed of the snake increases as it snake goes on eating the fruit. 

There is a Highest Score which be 0 till "Highest Score :30" after 30, the score increases.

Whenever the snake touched the boundary line of any 4 direction or if the snake intersects (face of the snake touches it's own tail) there is a popUp notification 
saying Game is Over! and the page will be refreshed by itself (within 2 seconds). 

There is also a score board where the score of the player increases by 10 points after the snake consumes 1 fruit (initially score will be 0). 

This is how my game looks like:

Whhen the snake eats some fruits and it's score board updates it looks as shown below:
